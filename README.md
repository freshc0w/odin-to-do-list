Brainstorm:
Gray background.
A slightly smaller container that covers the gray-bg.
On top there will be a navbar that has the logo and title of the To Do List on the left and contact info on the right. 

Dashboard on the side that outlines:
    - Home
        - Maybe can add a Today and This Week kinda functionality beneath this.
    - Projects
        - Could further extend by sorting by priority.
