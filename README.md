Brainstorm:
Gray background.
A slightly smaller container that covers the gray-bg.
On top there will be a navbar that has the logo and title of the To Do List on the left and contact info on the right. 

Dashboard on the side that outlines:
    - Home
        - Maybe can add a Today and This Week kinda functionality beneath this.
    - Projects
        - Could further extend by sorting by priority.
    - Notes 

For each project, it will be added to sideBar.
So i.e. the Today and This Week will be added beneath the Inbox tab and any other project will be added beneath the projects tab.
Also need to create a hover effect that when main tab is hovered, the side bars will be visible.
